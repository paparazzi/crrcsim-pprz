                         How to compile CRRCSim
                         
              ---------------------------------------------


General hints
=============

CRRCsim is built using the standard set of GNU Autotools
(autoheader, autoconf, automake, ...). Therefore there shouldn't
be much more to do than run the standard commands

  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make
  make install

To enable debugging symbols (if you want to work on the CRRCsim
code or track down bugs with GDB) you should ./configure CRRCsim
without optimization and with debugging enabled:

   ./configure CXXFLAGS="-g3 -O0"
   make
   make install

But beware: this is only tested on GNU/Linux and Windows (98/2k/XP).
On MacOSX this approach will most likely fail because the
configure.ac and Makefile.am have not been tested on this platform yet.
Please ask for help on the crrcsim-devel mailing list if you want
to compile CRRCsim on MacOSX.

If you want to use the audio interface (easiest way to plug your transmitter
to your PC), read audio_interface/readme.txt. To enable the audio interface,
the PortAudio library and development headers have to be installed
on your system. ./configure will automatically detect the PortAudio
version (18/19) and use the correct routines to access the library
or disable audio interface support if PortAudio was not found.


Below you'll find some platform-specific information for GNU/Linux and
Windows.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GNU/Linux
=========

First, make sure that you have installed the following packages including
all development packages (usually marked with a -dev or -devel suffix):

* SDL 1.2.x           (http://www.libsdl.org)
* PortAudio 18.1      (http://www.portaudio.org)
* PLIB 1.8.4 or later (http://plib.sourceforge.net/)
* libjpeg 6b          (http://www.ijg.org/)
* BOOST               (http://www.boost.org) : necessary for the installation of CGAL
* CGAL                (http://www.cgal.org) : necessary for Windfield import 
                                              in model-based Scnery(like Brie Scenery))
----------------


Usually your distribution will provide ready-made packages for those
libraries. If not, please look for further instructions on the
libraries' project home pages.

After you followed 'General hints' there usually is nothing more to do than
to issue 

   ./configure && make && make install

to get a working crrcsim.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Win32 - General
===============

The instructions for Windows are a bit lengthy, but they might
provide some valuable information which keeps you from encountering
the same problems that I had when I first tried to build the
project.

The first CRRCsim built for the Win32 platform (not counting the
crrcsim-f3f branch) was done using the Dev-C++ IDE (http://www.bloodshed.net)
which uses the MinGW32 compiler and binutils. If you'd like to compile 
CRRCsim yourself without using the command line, I recommend that you
download and install Dev-C++. The instructions in the "Win32 - Dev-C++"
section cover the rest of the compilation process. But be warned:
although you're using an IDE, it's a sometimes tedious and
annoying task to compile and/or install all the needed libraries.

That's one of the reasons why I moved on to using MSYS, the "Minimal SYStem"
(http://www.mingw.org). This package provides a Bourne-compatible
shell for Win32 systems and the necessary utilities to build
software "the Unix way" (./configure && make && make install).
It's relatively easy to set up and the compilation of all library
dependencies works like a charm. See the instructions in the
"Win32 - MSYS" section below if you want to do it this way.


Some general advice on using the GNU compiler gcc on Windows:

If you get a lot of linker errors after a successful compiler run
although you specified all needed libraries there might be something
wrong with the order in which you specified the libs. mingw32-g++ requires
that a library libFoo.a which has references to symbols from libBar.a
must be specified on the command line BEFORE libBar.a! So the correct
order for those two libs will be -lFoo -lBar. For CRRCsim, you need
to specify 
-lgle before -lglut and -lopengl32
 and
 -lplibpu before -lplibfnt and -lplibul.
Don't forget to link with -lmingw32 or you'll get an undefined
reference to WinMain()!


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Win32 - Dev-C++
===============

From now on I assume that you've installed a copy of Dev-C++ and
are familiar with the basic concepts of this IDE.

1. Install the SDL development package for Dev-C++
---------------------------------------------------
Dev-C++ provides an intelligent package management system which
allows easy installation and maintenance of additional libraries.
The easiest way to install SDL is to point the package manager
to the devpaks.org community server and download a ready-made
SDL package. This will automatically be installed to the correct
subdirectories of Dev-C++. The available SDL package might
not contain the very latest SDL release but even a slightly
older version should work (I used 1.2.4 while 1.2.7 was the
latest version from libsdl.org).

The less convenient way would be to download the MinGW32-port of
SDL directly from http://www.libsdl.org and copy the files
to the include and lib subdirs by hand.

In both cases you'll also need the SDL runtime (SDL.DLL) which
is available from http://www.libsdl.org. To run CRRCsim this
DLL must be in the same directory as CRRCsim-Win32.exe or
somewhere in your system path (e.g. c:\windows\system for Win98).

2. Install plib
----------------
You'll have to download the PLIB source package from http://plib.sf.net
and compile it yourself. Create a new Dev-C++ project, add
all files from one sub-library directory (e.g. src/ssg) and compile
this component into a static library (.a). Repeat this for all
needed library components.

Then you can copy the contents of the include and lib directories 
to your MinGW32 directories. Make sure that the headers reside in
"include\plib" and not directly in "include".

Since plib will be linked statically there is no need for a DLL.

3. Install PortAudio
--------------------
You can get the sources for the PortAudio SDK from http://www.portaudio.com/.
There are different implementations for the Windows platform: using
WMME (aka WAVE), using DirectSound or using ASIO drivers. Each
implementation has its pros and cons which are described on the
PortAudio web page. For the precompiled binary I chose the WMME
implementation, which might not be the best in terms of signal
latency, but which is the most compatible without the need to
install special drivers or libraries. Compile common\pa_lib.c and
pa_win_wmme\pa_win_wmme.c and roll them into a static library
called libportaudio.a.

If you don't want to compile it yourself, just download the
PortAudio 18.1 DevPak and you're done:

http://www.reucker-online.de/files/portaudio_wmme-18.1-1rej.DevPak

4. Check the include path
-------------------------
The path to the SDL include files has to be set manually in the
IDE since there is no replacement for `sdl-config --cflags` on
Win32. Open the CRRCsim-Win32.dev project file with Dev-C++ and go to
the project options dialog. Take a look at the additional include
directory. It should point to <your-Dev-C++-dir>/include/SDL.
Change it if you installed Dev-C++ to a non-standard directory.

5. Build CRRCsim
----------------
The rest should be easy, at least for Dev-C++-users:  hit the compile
button and wait for the build process to finish. You will be rewarded
with a "CRRCsim-Win32.exe".

6. Install CRRCsim
------------------
The easiest way is to run the make_package.bat in the main directory.
This should create a subdirectory called "crrcsim-win32" with copies
of all necessary files from the source package, not including the
extra DLL (SDL.dll). You can simply copy this directory
to a location of your choice and add an entry to your start menu.

To create a professional-looking installer, simply get NSIS from
http://nsis.sourceforge.net, install it and run the NSIS compiler
on the included crrcsim.nsi script. You will end up with a 
"CRRCsim-Win32-x.y.z.exe" that contains everything necessary to run
CRRCsim and will install it by a simple double-click.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Win32 - MSYS
============

These instructions will be less verbose, focussing on the steps
necessary to install MinGW, MSYS and all library dependencies.

1. Install MinGW
----------------
The MinGW package provides the GNU compiler (gcc) and some
additional utilities.
The easiest way is to install the MinGW compiler suite is to
grab the net-based installer from

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435

Look in the "Current" section of the download file list. At the
time of writing this document, "MinGW-5.1.3.exe" was the
current stable version.

This installer will prompt you to select which subcomponents
you'd like to install. Make sure that the "mingw-make" is NOT
selected, it will only cause trouble and MSYS will install a
working "make" later on! You need the g++ package, so set
the check mark in front of it.

2. Install MSYS
---------------
From http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml, get the "current"
MSYS and msysDTK binary ("bin") packages (at the time of writing:
MSYS-1.0.10.exe and msysDTK-1.0.1.exe.

Install MSYS first. It should autodetect your MinGW installation
and configure it properly. Then install the msysDTK.

If you actually want to work on CRRCsim and help with development
you'll want to install GDB for debugging. Get the GDB package
(a.t.t.o.w.: gdb-5.2.1-1.exe) and install it into the MinGW
directory (the installer should auto-detect this directory
and recommend it for installation).

3. Install SDL
--------------
Download the source package from http://www.libsdl.org to your
MSYS home directory, start MSYS, untar the file 
("tar xvzf file.tar.gz"), cd to the newly created SDL directory
and type "./configure && make && make install".

4. Install PLIB
---------------
Download the source package from http://plib.sf.net to your
MSYS home directory, start MSYS, untar the file 
("tar xvzf file.tar.gz"), cd to the newly created plib directory
and type "./configure && make && make install".

5. Install Portaudio 18
-----------------------
Download the source package from http://www.portaudio.com to your
MSYS home directory, start MSYS, untar the file 
("tar xvzf file.tar.gz"), cd to the newly created portaudio directory
and type "./configure --prefix=/usr && make && make install".

6. Install libjpeg 6b
---------------------
Download the source package from http://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz
to your MSYS home directory, start MSYS, untar the file
("tar xvzf jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz"), cd to the newly created jpeg-6b
directory and type "./configure --prefix=/usr && make && make install-lib && make install-headers".

7. Install BOOST (necessary for the installation of CGAL)
----------------
http://www.boost.org.
The version 1.32 is sufficient and lighter than recent version. Direct link:
"http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.32.0/boost_1_32_0.tar.gz/download"
Download the source package to your MSYS home directory, start MSYS, untar the file
("tar xvzf boost_1_32_0.tar.gz").
No compilation needed, only headers are useful. To copy the directory boost in the directory include of Mingw.
("cp -R boost_1_32_0/boost/  ../../MinGW/include")


8. Install CGAL (necessary for Windfield import in model-based Scnery (like Brie Scenery))
----------------

Download the source package cgal-3.3.1 to your MSYS home directory, from http://www.cgal.org.
(direct link :"ftp://ftp.mpi-sb.mpg.de/pub/outgoing/CGAL/CGAL-3.3.1.tar.gz"),
start MSYS, untar the file ("tar xvzf CGAL-3.3.1.tar.gz").
cd to the newly created CGAL-3.3.1 directory and type
"./install_cgal --prefix /usr"


9. Build CRRCsim
----------------
In the crrcsim directory, type 
"./configure"

Then type "make" to build CRRCsim.

10. Build an installer
---------------------
Install NSIS from http://nsis.sourceforge.net and add it to your
MSYS path (export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/makensis.exe). You can
make this setting permanent by creating a file called ".profile"
in your home directory that looks like this (adjust the to match
your system!):

#!/bin/sh
export PATH=$PATH:/c/Programme/NSIS

Not to forget of dll in installer :
 Make all
 bash
 export PATH=""
 ./crrcsim.exe
 < If a dll is missing, It is necessary to copy it in the crrcsim directory >
 exit
 
Now type "make win32package" in the crrcsim directory
to create the installer.
