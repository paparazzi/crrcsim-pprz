/**
 * An abstract base class for height representation classes
 *
 * There are many ways to store and access height data for the landscape.
 * This abstract base class defines the common interface for all specific
 * implementations.
 *
 * Coordinate system for this class and all subclasses:
 * x = positive north, negative south
 * y = positive east, negative west
 * z = positive down, negative up
 *
 * The z-axis might seem to be reverted in this system (because mountain tops
 * have a lower z value than valleys), but sticking to the classical conventions
 * (north and east are positive) the z-axis must point to the center of the earth
 * if the coordinate system is right-handed (thumb points north, index finger east,
 * middle finger down). This is what CRRCsim's FDM refers to as "local coordinates"
 * (or "world coordinates").
