/**
 * This is the interface used by the (various) FDMs to get information from the outside:
 *   - scenery for collision detection
 *   - windfield data
 *   - enviromental data like air density and gravitational acceleration
 * An instance of an implementation of this is passed to the FDM upon creation. This seems
 * quite expensive, but helps to separate this module (FDM) quite well.
 * It makes it possible to combine any FDM with any windfield and any enviroment (earth, any 
 * other planet). 
 * In contrast to original CRRCSim it assumes earth has a flat surface and 
 *    air density
 *    gravitational acceleration
 * do only depend on altitude.
 * 
 * Additionally it allows a callback from the fdm to include controllers.
